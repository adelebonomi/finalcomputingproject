         <h1>Wine Production, Consumption, and Reviews Around the World</h1>
         <p>To better understand wine trends worldwide, we focused on wine consumption and production over time. We were particularly interested in the price of specific wines based on location or province. To unpack our data, we created visualizations that depict trends and differences across time and region. Such factors we considered included wine consumption based on one's country of origin and wine production in varying countries and regions of the world. Lastly, we sought to compare the quality of wine with specific variables like fixed acidity.</p>

            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>Our exploratory questions consisted of the following. In Spain specifically, how does the region of cultivation and production impact the price of the wine? What countries/regions produce the most wine? What countries/regions consume the most wine? How do certain variables like fixed acidity affect overall wine quality?   .</p>

         <h1>Our Data Sources</h1>
         <p>Most of our data is derived from the data science community platform Kaggle. Upon finding datasets, we were tasked with cleaning some 130,000+ rows to make them suitable for visualization creation and analysis. One segment of our research honed in on the provinces of Spain and how the prices of their wines vary. Aside from Kaggle, we found global wine production and consumption datasets on Statista.</p>

         <h1>Our Data Journey and Caveats</h1>
         <p>When we began our data journey, we encountered difficulty finding datasets that would allow us to create meaningful and diverse visualizations. Thanks to Kaggle and Statista, we overcame our struggles and found powerful yet lengthy datasets. After cleaning our data into a more accessible form, we created dataframes that laid the foundation for our visualizations. Experimenting with matplotlib.pyplot and plotly express, we created both static and interactive visualizations that tell an interesting story about the wines of the world. The process was not without trial and error, but it paid off in the end.</p>

         <h1>Who We Are!</h1>
         <p>Adele and Grace (22 and 21 respectively) both have a passion and appreciation for fine wines! Grace and Adele met in a Roman art history class sophomore year and became fast friends. The rest is history! While Grace enjoys cheap, sugary wines, Adele prefers cabernets and chardonnays.</p>

            <h6>Wine Consumption Across the World in 2023</h6>

            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>This visualization shows wine consumption by country at a particular moment in time. Perhaps to little surprise, sommelier countries France, Italy, and Portugal are the darkest shades on the map with 20.56, 17.24, and 14.12 liters of wine consumed on a per capita basis in 2023. In majority-Muslim countries, such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, wine consumption is at or around 0, perhaps a testament to the Islamic Faith's ban on alcohol. It is fascinating to see how cultural trends and philosophies impacted wine consumption in 2023, and this is a trend we will continue to witness over time.</p>

               <p>In this graph, we focus particularly on Spain and the prices of its wine from various provinces. There is a notable outlier here, priced hundreds of euros higher than its counterparts in the dataset. That is El Perer, a single-vineyard Carignan grape wine from the Priorat region of Catalonia. While this graph does not express that level of specificity, it helps one make conclusions about the Spanish provinces and their abilities to create delicious, acclaimed, highly-priced wines.</p>

               <p>This graph depicts  wine production in countries and regions across the world in 2023. As is illustrated in the visualization, Europe came out on top in terms of wine production, with North America following not too far behind. Oceania, South America, Asia, and Africa had much lower rates of wine production, but they are impressive nonetheless.</p>

            <div class="col-md-9">
               <p>This visualization suggests a dramatic fluctuation in the wine market between 2019 and 2023. The decrease in wine sales from 2019 to 2020 is likely a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This low figure makes sense, considering restaurants shut down and could not serve wine to customers. Furthermore, social distancing reduced the number of gatherings, making individual alcohol purchases less frequent. The slow rise of the market in 2021 is a product of the economy restarting following the pandemic.</p>

               <p>This visualization depicts wine production in tons throughout the world, starting at 1961 and advancing all the way to 2020. With most destinations in the dark blue category, pointing out countries such as Europe with ligher purple tones allows an observer to see that these regions produce significantly more wine than others across the world. To provide an example, in 2017, America produced 2.17 million tons of wine, compared to France producing 3.637 tons of wine. This indepth and expansive graph allows an individual to explore the changes in prodcution over time based on region and country regarding wine.</p>

         <h1>Learning and conclusions</h1>
         <p>From this project, Grace and Adele were able to put our newfound skills in coding to work. While we started the project unsure of our exact end point for analzying our data, we were able to find and analyze extensive data sets. What started as a curiosity to learn more about wine production, consumption, reviews and market prices, escalated into a way for us to put to work our skills working with HTML. Creating visualizations that were informative, insightful and interactive was our favorite part of the project, as we are able to share our knowledge of fine wines with the members of our class and others who are interested!</p>
